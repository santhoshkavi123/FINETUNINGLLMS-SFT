I can\\'t see what that might be, however (squaring all the expressions didn\\'t really help).\\n\\nI\\'d appreciate some views: am I missing a trick, or was this particular question simply testing knowledge of some common values?\\n\\nEDIT: after the very helpful answers, which certainly showed that there was a much satisfying and general way of approaching the original question, can I also ask about another version of the question which included (d) $\\\\sqrt[4]{101}$.\\n\\nWhen approaching the question by approximation, I simply observed that $\\\\sqrt[4]{101}$ is only a tiny bit greater than $\\\\sqrt{10}$, and hence it still was clear to choose (c) as the answer. Is there any elegant way to extend the more robust methods to handle this case?\\n\\n• +1 for providing context (your first two sentences), something that nearly all questions at this level fail to do, and for providing a nice explanation of your concern. Incidentally, for math aptitude and other tests, it has always been my understanding that the questions are NOT testing whether you know the approximations, but whether you can perform the type of analysis in the answer by @Lord Shark the Unknown. Of course, unless the question writer puts some effort behind writing such questions, such questions can often be solved by your method. Sep 19 \\'18 at 10:41\\n• Thank you for all the comments and answers. I am pleased I chose to ask the question at MSE -- there was indeed something to learn here! Sep 20 \\'18 at 10:05\\n\\nComparing $$\\\\sqrt{10}$$ and $$\\\\sqrt2+\\\\sqrt3$$ is the same as comparing $$10$$ and $$(\\\\sqrt2+\\\\sqrt3)^2=5+2\\\\sqrt6$$. That\\'s the same as comparing $$5$$ and $$2\\\\sqrt6$$. Which of these is bigger?\\n\\nLikewise comparing $$\\\\sqrt{10}$$ and $$5-\\\\sqrt3$$ is the same as comparing $$10$$ and $$(5-\\\\sqrt3)^2=28-10\\\\sqrt3$$. That\\'s the same as comparing $$10\\\\sqrt3$$ and $$18$$.\\n\\nWhich of these is bigger?\\n\\n• Ah .... yes of course ... $5=\\\\sqrt{25}>\\\\sqrt{24}=2\\\\sqrt6$ Sep 19 \\'18 at 10:30\\n• Thank you for the hint! Sep 19 \\'18 at 10:32\\n• BBO555, regarding $5$ and $2\\\\sqrt{6},$ you can simply square again and compare the resulting squared values (although what you did in your comment is quite nice). This relies on the property that, when $a$ and $b$ are positive (or even when they are nonnegative), then we have: $a < b$ if and only if $a^2 < b^2$ (this can be \"seen\" by considering the graph of $y = x^2$ for $x\\\\geq0).$ Incidentally, the analogous result for cubing also is true and the result for cubing doesn\\'t require the numbers to be positive (consider the graph of $y = x^3).$ Sep 19 \\'18 at 10:47\\n\\nYou can use:\\n\\n(1) the fact that $f(x)=x^2$ is a monotonically increasing function when $x\\\\geq0$ and\\n\\n(2) the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality $\\\\sqrt{ab}\\\\leq\\\\frac{a+b}{2}$, when $a, b\\\\geq0$. Hence, $$(\\\\sqrt{2}+\\\\sqrt{3})^2=5+2\\\\sqrt{2\\\\cdot3}\\\\leq5+2\\\\frac{2+3}{2}=5+5=10=(\\\\sqrt{10})^2$$ Therefore, using (1), we obtain $\\\\sqrt{2}+\\\\sqrt{3}\\\\leq 10$. I forgot about this: $$5-\\\\sqrt{3}=3+2-\\\\sqrt{3}=3+\\\\frac{1}{2+\\\\sqrt{3}}\\\\geq3+\\\\frac{1}{2+2}=3.25$$ One can easily verify that $(3+1/4)^2>10.5>10$. One also finds that $10.5^2>110>101$.\\n\\nThen, performing argument (1) twice, one finds that $5-\\\\sqrt{3}>(101)^{1/4}$.\\n\\n## Consequently, $5-\\\\sqrt{3}$ is the bigger number.\\n\\n• I would add that you can also \"round down\" at an intermediate stage of the computation. If you are trying to prove $a \\\\gt b$ sometimes you can find an expression $c$ that is simpler than $a$ where $a \\\\gt c$, do some more manipulation, and show $c \\\\gt b$. The numerical estimates are useful for this because they tell you how much room you have. You might find that rough approximations work, or you might need to be quite careful.

       "  '# Golden Ratio and Fibonacci Numbers\\n\\nGolden Ratio is considered to be one of the greatest beauties in mathematics. Two numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$ are said to be in Golden Ratio if $a>b>0,\\\\quad and\\\\quad \\\\frac { a }{ b } =\\\\frac { a+b }{ a }$ If we consider this ratio to be equal to some $$\\\\varphi$$ then we have $\\\\varphi =\\\\frac { a }{ b } =\\\\frac { a+b }{ a } =1+\\\\frac { b }{ a } =1+\\\\frac { 1 }{ \\\\varphi }$ Solving in quadratic we get two values of $$\\\\varphi$$, viz. $$\\\\frac { 1+\\\\sqrt { 5 } }{ 2 }$$ and $$\\\\frac { 1-\\\\sqrt { 5 } }{ 2 }$$ one of which (the second one) turns out to be negative (extraneous) which we eliminate. So the first one is taken to be the golden ratio (which is obviously a constant value). It is considered that objects with their features in golden ratio are aesthetically more pleasant. A woman\\'s face is in general more beautiful than a man\\'s face since different features of a woman\\'s face are nearly in the golden ratio.\\n\\nNow let us come to Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence $${ \\\\left( { F }_{ n } \\\\right) }_{ n\\\\ge 1 }$$ is a natural sequence of the following form:${ F }_{ 1 }=1,\\\\quad { F }_{ 2 }=1,\\\\quad { F }_{ n-1 }+{ F }_{ n }={ F }_{ n+1 }$ The sequence written in form of a list, is $$1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,..$$.\\n\\nThe two concepts: The Golden Ratio and The Fibonacci Sequence, which seem to have completely different origins, have an interesting relationship, which was first observed by Kepler. He observed that the golden ratio is the limit of the ratios of successive terms of the Fibonacci sequence or any Fibonacci-like sequence (by Fibonacci-like sequence, I mean sequences with the recursion relation same as that of the Fibonacci Sequence, but the seed values different). In terms of limit:$\\\\underset { n\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty }{ lim } \\\\left( \\\\frac { { F }_{ n+1 } }{ { F }_{ n } } \\\\right) =\\\\varphi$ We shall now prove this fact. Let ${ R }_{ n }=\\\\frac { { F }_{ n+1 } }{ { F }_{ n } } ,\\\\forall n\\\\in N$Then we have $$\\\\forall n\\\\in N$$ and $$n\\\\ge 2$$, ${ F }_{ n+1 }={ F }_{ n }+{ F }_{ n-1 }\\\\\\\\$ and ${ R }_{ n }=1+\\\\frac { 1 }{ { R }_{ n-1 } } >1$We shall show that this ratio sequence goes to the Golden Ratio $$\\\\varphi$$ given by: $\\\\varphi =1+\\\\frac { 1 }{ \\\\varphi }$We see that: $\\\\left| { R }_{ n }-\\\\varphi \\\\right| =\\\\left| \\\\left( 1+\\\\frac { 1 }{ { R }_{ n-1 } } \\\\right) -\\\\left( 1+\\\\frac { 1 }{ \\\\varphi } \\\\right) \\\\right| \\\\\\\\ =\\\\left| \\\\frac { 1 }{ { R }_{ n-1 } } -\\\\frac { 1 }{ \\\\varphi } \\\\right| \\\\\\\\ =\\\\left| \\\\frac { \\\\varphi -{ R }_{ n-1 } }{ \\\\varphi { R }_{ n-1 } } \\\\right| \\\\\\\\ \\\\le \\\\left( \\\\frac { 1 }{ \\\\varphi } \\\\right) \\\\left| \\\\varphi -{ R }_{ n-1 } \\\\right|\\\\\\\\ \\\\le { \\\\left( \\\\frac { 1 }{ \\\\varphi } \\\\right) }^{ n-2 }\\\\left| { R }_{ 2 }-\\\\varphi \\\\right|$ Which clearly shows that$\\\\left( { R }_{ n } \\\\right) \\\\longrightarrow \\\\varphi$ (since $$\\\\left| { R }_{ 2 }-\\\\varphi \\\\right|$$ is a finite positive real whose value depends on the seed values)\\n\\nNote by Kuldeep Guha Mazumder\\n2\\xa0years, 11\\xa0months ago\\n\\nMarkdownAppears as\\n*italics* or _italics_ italics\\n**bold** or __bold__ bold\\n- bulleted- list\\n• bulleted\\n• list\\n1. numbered2. list\\n1. numbered\\n2. list\\nNote: you must add a full line of space before and after lists for them to show up correctly\\nparagraph 1paragraph 2\\n\\nparagraph 1\\n\\nparagraph 2\\n\\n[example link](https://brilliant.org)example link\\n> This is a quote\\nThis is a quote\\n    # I indented these lines\\n# 4 spaces, and now they show\\n# up as a code block.\\n\\nprint \"hello world\"\\n# I indented these lines\\n# 4 spaces, and now they show\\n# up as a code block.\\n\\nprint \"hello world\"\\nMathAppears as\\nRemember to wrap math in $$...$$ or $...$ to ensure proper formatting.\\n2 \\\\times 3 $$2 \\\\times 3$$\\n2^{34} $$2^{34}$$\\na_{i-1} $$a_{i-1}$$\\n\\\\frac{2}{3} $$\\\\frac{2}{3}$$\\n\\\\sqrt{2} $$\\\\sqrt{2}$$\\n\\\\sum_{i=1}^3 $$\\\\sum_{i=1}^3$$\\n\\\\sin \\\\theta $$\\\\sin \\\\theta$$\\n\\\\boxed{123} $$\\\\boxed{123}$$\\n\\nSort by:\\n\\n- 2\\xa0years, 11\\xa0months ago\\n\\nYou are welcome!

       "  '# For any arrangment of numbers 1 to 10 in a circle, there will always exist a pair of 3 adjacent numbers in the circle that sum up to 17 or more\\n\\nI set out to solve the following question using the pigeonhole principle\\n\\nRegardless of how one arranges numbers $1$ to $10$ in a circle, there will always exist a pair of three adjacent numbers in the circle that sum up to $17$ or more.\\n\\nMy outline\\n\\n[1] There are $10$ triplets consisting of adjacent numbers in the circle, and since each number appears thrice, the total sum of these adjacent triplets for all permutations of the number in the circle, is $3\\\\cdot 55=165$.\\n\\n[2] If we consider that all the adjacent triplets sum to 16 , and since there are $10$ such triplets, the sum accordingly would be $160$, but we just said the invariant sum is $165$ hence there would have to be a triplet with sum of $17$ or more.\\n\\nMy query\\n\\nCould someone polish this into a mathematical proof and also clarify if I did make use of the pigeonhole principle.\\n\\n• Yes, you used pigeonhole. Should say if all sums are $\\\\le 16$, then the sum is $\\\\le 160$. –\\xa0André Nicolas May 25 \\'13 at 4:42\\n• @AndréNicolas noted and aha , the syntax part is exactly why I asked the question on here. –\\xa0metric-space May 25 \\'13 at 4:44\\n• @nerorevenge Note: You can actually show that the 3 adjacent numbers sum to 18 or more. –\\xa0Calvin Lin May 25 \\'13 at 8:37\\n\\nYes, you used the Pigeonhole Principle. As a very mild correction, you should say that of all sums of three consecutives are $\\\\le 16$, then the sum is $\\\\le 160$.\\n\\nThe proof (with the small correction) is already fully mathematical. Conceivably you might want to explain the $55$ further. It is clear to you and to most users of this site why $55$, but imagine the reader to be easily puzzled.\\n\\nThe part about \"all the permutations\" is vague, and technically incorrect. You are finding the sum of a consecutive triple, and summing all these sums. Permutations have nothing to do with it, we are talking about a particular fixed arrangement of the numbers.\\n\\nRemark: We could use a lot of symbols. Starting at a particular place, and going counterclockwise, let our numbers be $a_1,a_2,\\\\dots,a_{10}$. For any $i$, where $1\\\\le i\\\\le 10$, let $S_i=a_i+a_{i+1}+a_{i+2}$, where we use the convention that $a_{10+1}=a_1$, $a_{10+2}=a_2$, and $a_{9+2}=a_1$.\\n\\nThen $S_1+S_1+\\\\cdots+S_{10}=165$, since each of $1$ to $10$ appears in $3$ of the $S_i$, and $1+2+\\\\cdots+10=55$.\\n\\nBut if all the $S_i$ are $\\\\le 16$, then $\\\\sum_{i=1}^{10}S_i\\\\le 160$. This contradicts the fact that $\\\\sum_{i=1}^{10}S_i=165$.\\n\\nI prefer your proof, mildly modified.\\n\\n• eh, is that all? the reason I\\'m asking is that, inb the past my so called \\'proofs\\' have been criticised for being too informal –\\xa0metric-space May 25 \\'13 at 4:45\\n• @nerorevenge: I am an advocate of the informal but clear. I hope that someone more formal-minded will add an answer. The only issue is that you perhaps left an easily filled gap or two. –\\xa0André Nicolas May 25 \\'13 at 4:53\\n• I have added another criticism. You should really fix the wording there. –\\xa0André Nicolas May 25 \\'13 at 4:58\\n• I agree.That definitely is vaguely worded. –\\xa0metric-space May 25 \\'13 at 4:59\\n• Presumably the \"pair\" wording came with the problem. But it looks funny to call a trio a pair. –\\xa0André Nicolas May 25 \\'13 at 5:23\\n\\nWe will show something stronger, namely that there exists 3 adjacent numbers that sum to 18 or more.\\n\\nLet the integers be $\\\\{a_i\\\\}_{i=1}^{10}$. WLOG, $a_1 = 1$. Consider\\n\\n$$a_2 + a_3 + a_4, a_5 + a_6 + a_7, a_8 + a_9 + a_{10}$$\\n\\nThe sum of these 3 numbers is $2+3 +\\\\ldots + 10 = 54$. Hence, by the pigeonhole principle, there exists one number which is at least $\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{54}{3} \\\\rfloor = 18$.\\n\\nI leave it to you to show that there is a construction where no 3 adjacent numbers sum to 19 or more, which shows that 18 is the best that we can do.\\n\\n• definitely a stronger proof ,and I have admit it sure is nice, I wonder why cut-the-knot.org didn\\'t ask people to solve for what you proved. –\\xa0metric-space May 25 \\'13 at 16:45\\n• @nerorevenge I used this as a problem on Brilliant.org, and most could only get to 17, and didn\\'t understand why 18 must be true. The 18 case arises quite easily by ignoring the small values which would otherwise reduce our sum. –\\xa0Calvin Lin May 25 \\'13 at 23:37',\n",

I tried by induction but i didn\\'t get anywhere\\n\\n-\\n\\nAn answer just by induction on $n$ of the equality $F_{2n}=F_n(F_{n-1}+F_{n+1})$ is as follows:\\n\\nFor $n=2$ we have $3=F_4=(1+3)\\\\cdot 1=(F_1+F_3)F_2$.\\n\\nTo go from $n$ to $n+1$:\\n\\n\\\\begin{align} F_{2n+2}&=3F_{2n}-F_{2n-2}\\\\\\\\ &=3(F_{n-1}+F_{n+1})F_n-(F_{n-2}+F_n)F_{n-1}\\\\\\\\ &=F_{n-1}(3F_n-F_n-F_{n-2})+3F_{n+1}F_n\\\\\\\\ &=F_{n-1}(F_n+F_{n-1})+3F_{n+1}F_n\\\\\\\\ &=F_{n-1}F_{n+1}+3F_{n+1}F_n\\\\\\\\ &=F_{n+1}(3F_n+F_{n-1})\\\\\\\\ &=F_{n+1}(2F_n+F_{n+1})\\\\\\\\ &=F_{n+1}(F_n+F_{n+2}) \\\\end{align}\\n\\n-\\n\\nA combinatorial interpretation:\\n\\n$F_n$ is the number of ways to tile a row of $(n-1)$ squares with $1\\\\times 1$ blocks and $1\\\\times 2$ blocks.\\n\\nThe left hand side is the number of ways to tile a $1\\\\times (2n-1)$ block with $1\\\\times 1$ and $1\\\\times 2$ blocks. Consider the middle square (the $(n-1)$th square.)\\n\\nCase 1: It is used in a $1\\\\times 1$ block. Then, there are $F_{n}$ ways to tile each of the $1 \\\\times (n-1)$ blocks on each side of the middle, so $F_n^2$ total.\\n\\nCase 2: It is used in a $1\\\\times 2$ block. This block contains the $(n-1)$th square and either the $n$th or the $(n-2)$th square. In either case, there are $F_{n-1}$ ways to tile the shorter side and $F_n$ ways to tile the longer side.\\n\\nWe thus have $F_{2n} = F_n^2 + 2F_nF_{n-1},$ as desired.\\n\\n-\\nI didn\\'t have mentioned about your way of doing it. I can\\'t fully understand your solution. The man said it\\'s solutionable by induction –\\xa0 matiit Oct 14 \\'12 at 15:27\\nNot useful to the OP, perhaps, but still very nice. –\\xa0 Brian M. Scott Oct 14 \\'12 at 15:46\\n\\nThis is very related to the answer at Showing that an equation holds true with a Fibonacci sequence: $F_{n+m} = F_{n-1}F_m + F_n F_{m+1}$\\n\\nThat question has the identity:\\n\\n$F_{n+m} = F_{n-1}F_m + F_n F_{m+1}$\\n\\nwhich can be modeled to your identity by letting $n=m$\\n\\n$F_{2n} = F_{n-1}F_n + F_n F_{n+1}$\\n\\n$F_{2n} = F_n(F_{n-1} + F_{n+1})$\\n\\nSetting the expression inside the parenthesis to:\\n\\n$F_{n-1} + F_{n+1} = F_{n-1}+ F_{n-1} + F_{n} = F_n + 2F_{n-1}$\\n\\nWe get\\n\\n$F_{2n} = F_n(F_n+2F_{n-1})$\\n\\nWhich is your identity. So work backwards to that identity and use the proof at the linked question to prove your relation.\\n\\n-\\n\\nHere’s a purely computational proof. Let $$A=\\\\pmatrix{F_2&F_1\\\\\\\\F_1&F_0}=\\\\pmatrix{1&1\\\\\\\\1&0}\\\\;;$$ a straightforward induction shows that $$A^n=\\\\pmatrix{F_{n+1}&F_n\\\\\\\\F_n&F_{n-1}}$$ for all $n\\\\ge 1$. Then\\n\\n\\\\begin{align*} \\\\pmatrix{F_{m+n+1}&F_{m+n}\\\\\\\\F_{m+n}&F_{m+n-1}}&=A^{m+n}\\\\\\\\ &=A^mA^n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\pmatrix{F_{m+1}&F_m\\\\\\\\F_m&F_{m-1}}\\\\pmatrix{F_{n+1}&F_n\\\\\\\\F_n&F_{n-1}}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\pmatrix{F_{m+1}F_{n+1}+F_mF_n&F_{m+1}F_n+F_mF_{n-1}\\\\\\\\F_mF_{n+1}+F_{m-1}F_n&F_mF_n+F_{m-1}F_{n-1}}\\\\;, \\\\end{align*}\\n\\nso $F_{m+n}=F_{m+1}F_n+F_mF_{n-1}$. Take $m=n$, and this becomes\\n\\n$$F_{2n}=F_{n+1}F_n+F_nF_{n-1}=F_n\\\\left(F_{n+1}+F_{n-1}\\\\right)=F_n\\\\left(F_n+2F_{n-1}\\\\right)\\\\;.$$\\n\\n-\\nExact duplicate of Zchpyvr\\'s 21-minute prior answer (you\\'ve simply inlined the lemma that he links to). –\\xa0 Bill Dubuque Oct 14 \\'12 at 19:06\\n@Bill: I’m not terribly surprised. However, I didn’t see his answer until after I posted, and when I did see it, I was busy and didn’t feel like chasing down the link. And quite frankly, I don’t consider it an exact duplicate for that very reason. –\\xa0 Brian M. Scott Oct 14 \\'12 at 21:52\\nIt is most certainly an exact duplicate. As I said, you\\'ve simply inlined the link in the other answer. Lacking anything new, it should be deleted for the sake of the readers. –\\xa0 Bill Dubuque Oct 14 \\'12 at 21:58\\n@Bill: You have a rather inexact definition of exact. The fact that the information is right on the page is a difference, in convenience if nothing else. And deleting it does not serve the readers; slightly the reverse, if anything, for that same reason. The only person whom it might possibly ill serve is Zchpyvr, and I’ve upvoted his answer. And that’s the end of it as far as I’m concerned. –\\xa0 Brian M. Scott Oct 14 \\'12 at 22:04\\nPosting duplicate answers potentially wastes many reader\\'s time, since they may read two or more answers when it would have sufficed to read one. Not to mention that the abstraction in Zchpyvr\\'s answer gained by calling the lemma by name (vs. value) only serves to make the answer more comprehensible. By your argument, every textbook should inline the proof of all lemma\\'s so that they are \"right on the page\". That is, of course, absurd. –\\xa0 Bill Dubuque Oct 14 \\'12 at 22:14\\n\\nAnother direct proof, using the fact that\\n\\n$$F_n=\\\\frac{\\\\phi^n-(1-\\\\phi)^n}{\\\\sqrt5}\\\\tag1$$\\n\\nwhere\\n\\n$$\\\\phi=\\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt5}{2},\\\\qquad1-\\\\phi=\\\\frac{1-\\\\sqrt5}{2}=-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\phi}.$$\\n\\nFrom $(1)$ we have\\n\\n$$s_n\\\\equiv\\\\frac{F_{2n}}{F_n}=\\\\frac{\\\\phi^{2n}-(1-\\\\phi)^{2n}}{\\\\phi^n-(1-\\\\phi)^n}=\\\\phi^n+(1-\\\\phi)^n$$\\n\\nthen\\n\\n\\\\begin{align} s_n-F_n&=\\\\phi^n+(1-\\\\phi)^n-\\\\frac{\\\\phi^n-(1-\\\\phi)^n}{\\\\sqrt5}=\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt5}\\\\left[\\\\sqrt5\\\\phi^n+\\\\sqrt5(1-\\\\phi)^n-\\\\phi^n+(1-\\\\phi)^n\\\\right]=\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt5}\\\\left[-(1-\\\\sqrt5)\\\\phi^n+(1+\\\\sqrt5)(1-\\\\phi)^n\\\\right]=\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt5}\\\\left[-2(1-\\\\phi)\\\\phi^n+2\\\\phi(1-\\\\phi)^n\\\\right]=\\\\\\\\ &=-\\\\frac{2\\\\phi(1-\\\\phi)}{\\\\sqrt5}\\\\left[\\\\phi^{n-1}-(1-\\\\phi)^{n-1}\\\\right]=2F_{n-1} \\\\end{align}\\n\\n-\\n\\nThis can be done also using the fact that\\n\\n$$F_n = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{5}}\\\\left(\\\\sigma^n-\\\\bar{\\\\sigma}^n\\\\right),$$\\n\\nfrom which it is easy to get\\n\\n$$F_{2n} = F_n L_n,$$\\n\\n(where $L_n$ is the $n$-th Lucas number) and we have only to prove\\n\\n$$L_n= F_n+2F_{n-1},$$\\n\\nthat is true since $\\\\{L_n\\\\}_{n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}}$ and $\\\\{F_n+2F_{n-1}\\\\}_{n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}}$ are sequences with the same characteristic polynomial ($x^2-x-1$) and the same starting values $L_1=F_1+2F_0=1$, $L_2=F_2+2F_1=3$.\\n\\n-']}"
