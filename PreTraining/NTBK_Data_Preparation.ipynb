We have 1. To understand the properties of transpose matrix, we will take two matrices A and B which have equal order. The identity matrix is a square matrix that has 1’s along the main diagonal and 0’s for all other entries. In a triangular matrix, the determinant is equal to the product of the diagonal elements. This matrix is often written simply as $$I$$, and is special in that it acts like 1 in matrix multiplication. Is the Inverse Property of Matrix Addition similar to the Inverse Property of Addition? The identity matrices (which are the square matrices whose entries are zero outside of the main diagonal and 1 on the main diagonal) are identity elements of the matrix product. Learning Objectives. In fact, this tutorial uses the Inverse Property of Addition and shows how it can be expanded to include matrices! Keywords: matrix; matrices; inverse; additive; additive inverse; opposite; Background Tutorials . Matrix Multiplication Properties 9:02. 16. Proof.

There are 10 important properties of determinants that are widely used. Go through the properties given below: Assume that, A, B and C be three m x n matrices, The following properties holds true for the matrix addition operation. The determinant of a 4×4 matrix can be calculated by finding the determinants of a group of submatrices. 13. If you built a random matrix and took its determinant, how likely would it be that you got zero? The first element of row one is occupied by the number 1 … In mathematics, matrix addition is the operation of adding two matrices by adding the corresponding entries together. Equality of matrices All-zero Property. Multiplying a $2 \\\\times 3$ matrix by a $3 \\\\times 2$ matrix is possible, and it gives a $2 \\\\times 2$ matrix … Properties of Transpose of a Matrix. The Commutative Property of Matrix Addition is just like the Commutative Property of Addition! The Distributive Property of Matrices states: A ( B + C ) = A B + A C Also, if A be an m × n matrix and B and C be n × m matrices, then Addition: There is addition law for matrix addition. Likewise, the commutative property of multiplication means the places of factors can be changed without affecting the result. Then the following properties hold: a) A+B= B+A(commutativity of matrix addition) b) A+(B+C) = (A+B)+C (associativity of matrix addition) c) There is a unique matrix O such that A+ O= Afor any m× nmatrix A. Since Theorem SMZD is an equivalence (Proof Technique E) we can expand on our growing list of equivalences about nonsingular matrices. Properties of matrix addition. Let A, B, and C be mxn matrices. The determinant of a 3 x 3 matrix (General & Shortcut Method) 15. PROPERTIES OF MATRIX ADDITION PRACTICE WORKSHEET. You should only add the element of one matrix to … Property 1 completes the argument. Let A, B, and C be three matrices of same order which are conformable for addition and a, b be two scalars. This means if you add 2 + 1 to get 3, you can also add 1 + 2 to get 3. For any natural number n > 0, the set of n-by-n matrices with real elements forms an Abelian group with respect to matrix addition. This tutorial uses the Commutative Property of Addition and an example to explain the Commutative Property of Matrix Addition.

This tutorial introduces you to the Identity Property of Matrix Addition. Instructor. Transcript. Important Properties of Determinants. Properties involving Addition and Multiplication: Let A, B and C be three matrices. Matrix addition and subtraction, where defined (that is, where the matrices are the same size so addition and subtraction make sense), can be turned into homework problems. A. Addition and Subtraction of Matrices: In matrix algebra the addition and subtraction of any two matrix is only possible when both the matrix is of same order. Selecting row 1 of this matrix will simplify the process because it contains a zero. We state them now. A diagonal matrix is called the identity matrix if the elements on its main diagonal are all equal to $$1.$$ (All other elements are zero). Question: THEOREM 2.1 Properties Of Matrix Addition And Scalar Multiplication If A, B, And C Are M X N Matrices, And C And D Are Scalars, Then The Properties Below Are True. A B _____ Commutative property of addition 2. Unlike matrix addition, the properties of multiplication of real numbers do not all generalize to matrices. Let A, B, and C be three matrices. 8. det A = 0 exactly when A is singular. 2. In other words, the placement of addends can be changed and the results will be equal. Then we have the following properties. 17. The basic properties of matrix addition is similar to the addition of the real numbers. Then we have the following: (1) A + B yields a matrix of the same order (2) A + B = B + A (Matrix addition is commutative) Properties of scalar multiplication. (A+B)+C = A + (B+C) 3. where is the mxn zero-matrix (all its entries are equal to 0); 4. if and only if B = -A. If the rows of the matrix are converted into columns and columns into rows, then the determinant remains unchanged. Laplace’s Formula and the Adjugate Matrix. 14.

EduRev, the Education Revolution! As with the commutative property, examples of operations that are associative include the addition and multiplication of real numbers, integers, and rational numbers. Matrix multiplication is really useful, since you can pack a lot of computation into just one matrix multiplication operation. Proposition (commutative property) Matrix addition is commutative, that is, for any matrices and and such that the above additions are meaningfully defined. 11. Numerical and Algebraic Expressions. The determinant of a 2 x 2 matrix. We can also say that the determinant of the matrix and its transpose are equal. Matrix Vector Multiplication 13:39. 12. Examples . In that case elimination will give us a row of zeros and property 6 gives us the conclusion we want. This property is known as reflection property of determinants. The inverse of a 2 x 2 matrix. However, unlike the commutative property, the associative property can also apply to matrix … The matrix O is called the zero matrix and serves as the additiveidentity for the set of m×nmatrices. 1.

Properties of Matrix Addition: Theorem 1.1Let A, B, and C be m×nmatrices. However, there are other operations which could also be considered addition for matrices, such as the direct sum and the Kronecker sum Entrywise sum. The determinant of a matrix is zero if each element of the matrix is equal to zero. A scalar is a number, not a matrix. Try the Course for Free. Use properties of linear transformations to solve problems. Matrix addition is associative; Subtraction. 18. A square matrix is called diagonal if all its elements outside the main diagonal are equal to zero. If we take transpose of transpose matrix, the matrix obtained is equal to the original matrix. Reflection Property. Inverse and Transpose 11:12. Taught By. 1. This is an immediate consequence of the fact that the commutative property applies to sums of scalars, and therefore to the element-by-element sums that are performed when carrying out matrix addition. There often is no multiplicative inverse of a matrix, even if the matrix is a square matrix. Mathematical systems satisfying these four conditions are known as Abelian groups.

       "  '# Comparing the magnitudes of expressions of surds\\n\\nI recently tackled some questions on maths-challenge / maths-aptitude papers where the task was to order various expressions made up of surds (without a calculator, obviously).\\n\\nI found myself wondering whether I was relying too much on knowing the numerical value of some common surds, when a more robust method was available (and would work in more difficult cases).\\n\\nFor example, one question asked which is the largest of:\\n\\n(a) $\\\\sqrt{10}$\\n(b) $\\\\sqrt2+\\\\sqrt3$\\n(c) $5-\\\\sqrt3$\\n\\nIn this case, I relied on my knowledge that $\\\\sqrt{10} \\\\approx 3.16$ and $\\\\sqrt2\\\\approx 1.41$ and $\\\\sqrt3 \\\\approx 1.73$ to find (a) $\\\\approx 3.16$, (b) $\\\\approx ~3.14$ and (c) $\\\\approx ~3.27$ so that the required answer is (c).\\n\\nBut this seemed inelegant: I felt there might be some way to manipulate the surd expressions to make the ordering more explicit. I can\\'t see what that might be, however (squaring all the expressions didn\\'t really help).\\n\\nI\\'d appreciate some views: am I missing a trick, or was this particular question simply testing knowledge of some common values?\\n\\nEDIT: after the very helpful answers, which certainly showed that there was a much satisfying and general way of approaching the original question, can I also ask about another version of the question which included (d) $\\\\sqrt[4]{101}$.\\n\\nWhen approaching the question by approximation, I simply observed that $\\\\sqrt[4]{101}$ is only a tiny bit greater than $\\\\sqrt{10}$, and hence it still was clear to choose (c) as the answer. Is there any elegant way to extend the more robust methods to handle this case?\\n\\n• +1 for providing context (your first two sentences), something that nearly all questions at this level fail to do, and for providing a nice explanation of your concern. Incidentally, for math aptitude and other tests, it has always been my understanding that the questions are NOT testing whether you know the approximations, but whether you can perform the type of analysis in the answer by @Lord Shark the Unknown. Of course, unless the question writer puts some effort behind writing such questions, such questions can often be solved by your method. Sep 19 \\'18 at 10:41\\n• Thank you for all the comments and answers. I am pleased I chose to ask the question at MSE -- there was indeed something to learn here! Sep 20 \\'18 at 10:05\\n\\nComparing $$\\\\sqrt{10}$$ and $$\\\\sqrt2+\\\\sqrt3$$ is the same as comparing $$10$$ and $$(\\\\sqrt2+\\\\sqrt3)^2=5+2\\\\sqrt6$$. That\\'s the same as comparing $$5$$ and $$2\\\\sqrt6$$. Which of these is bigger?\\n\\nLikewise comparing $$\\\\sqrt{10}$$ and $$5-\\\\sqrt3$$ is the same as comparing $$10$$ and $$(5-\\\\sqrt3)^2=28-10\\\\sqrt3$$. That\\'s the same as comparing $$10\\\\sqrt3$$ and $$18$$.\\n\\nWhich of these is bigger?\\n\\n• Ah .... yes of course ... $5=\\\\sqrt{25}>\\\\sqrt{24}=2\\\\sqrt6$ Sep 19 \\'18 at 10:30\\n• Thank you for the hint! Sep 19 \\'18 at 10:32\\n• BBO555, regarding $5$ and $2\\\\sqrt{6},$ you can simply square again and compare the resulting squared values (although what you did in your comment is quite nice). This relies on the property that, when $a$ and $b$ are positive (or even when they are nonnegative), then we have: $a < b$ if and only if $a^2 < b^2$ (this can be \"seen\" by considering the graph of $y = x^2$ for $x\\\\geq0).$ Incidentally, the analogous result for cubing also is true and the result for cubing doesn\\'t require the numbers to be positive (consider the graph of $y = x^3).$ Sep 19 \\'18 at 10:47\\n\\nYou can use:\\n\\n(1) the fact that $f(x)=x^2$ is a monotonically increasing function when $x\\\\geq0$ and\\n\\n(2) the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality $\\\\sqrt{ab}\\\\leq\\\\frac{a+b}{2}$, when $a, b\\\\geq0$. Hence, $$(\\\\sqrt{2}+\\\\sqrt{3})^2=5+2\\\\sqrt{2\\\\cdot3}\\\\leq5+2\\\\frac{2+3}{2}=5+5=10=(\\\\sqrt{10})^2$$ Therefore, using (1), we obtain $\\\\sqrt{2}+\\\\sqrt{3}\\\\leq 10$. I forgot about this: $$5-\\\\sqrt{3}=3+2-\\\\sqrt{3}=3+\\\\frac{1}{2+\\\\sqrt{3}}\\\\geq3+\\\\frac{1}{2+2}=3.25$$ One can easily verify that $(3+1/4)^2>10.5>10$. One also finds that $10.5^2>110>101$.\\n\\nThen, performing argument (1) twice, one finds that $5-\\\\sqrt{3}>(101)^{1/4}$.\\n\\n## Consequently, $5-\\\\sqrt{3}$ is the bigger number.\\n\\n• I would add that you can also \"round down\" at an intermediate stage of the computation. If you are trying to prove $a \\\\gt b$ sometimes you can find an expression $c$ that is simpler than $a$ where $a \\\\gt c$, do some more manipulation, and show $c \\\\gt b$. The numerical estimates are useful for this because they tell you how much room you have. You might find that rough approximations work, or you might need to be quite careful. Sep 19 \\'18 at 14:01\\n• Thanks for including a route to handling case (d) ! Sep 20 \\'18 at 8:07',\n",
       "  '# In Calculus, how can a function have several different, yet equal, derivatives?\\n\\nI\\'ve been pondering this question all night as I work through some problems, and after a very thorough search, I haven\\'t found anything completely related to my question. I guess i\\'m also curious how some derivatives are simplified as well, because in some cases I just can\\'t see the breakdown. Here is an example:\\n\\n$f(x) = \\\\dfrac{x^2-6x+12}{x-4}$ is the function I was differentiating. Here is what I got:\\n\\n$f \\'(x) = \\\\dfrac{x^2-8x+12}{(x-4)^2}$ which checks using desmos graphing utility.\\n\\nNow, when I checked my textbook(and Symbolab) they got:\\n\\n$f \\'(x) = 1 - \\\\dfrac{4}{(x-4)^2}$ which also checks on desmos.\\n\\nTo me, these derivatives look nothing alike, so how can they both be the equal to the derivative of the original function? Both methods used the quotient rule, yet yield very different results. Is one of these \"better\" than the other? I know that it is easier to find critical numbers with a more simplified derivative, but IMO the derivative I found seems easier to set equal to zero than the derivative found in my book.I also wasn\\'t able to figure out how the second derivative was simplified, so I stuck with mine.\\n\\nI\\'m obviously new to Calculus and i\\'m trying to understand the nuances of derivatives. When I ask most math people, including some professors, they just say \"that\\'s how derivatives are\" but for me, that\\'s not an acceptable answer. If someone can help me understand this, I would appreciate it.\\n\\n• You really really need to use parentheses in what you write. You mean to write $(x^2-8x+12)/(x-4)^2$. The point is that your two \"different\" answers are exactly the same because of algebra. –\\xa0Ted Shifrin Mar 12 \\'16 at 7:54\\n• Well i\\'m still learning the formatting so bear with me, and I obviously know they are the same because they are both the derived from the original function(and checked out). I was simply having a hard time visualizing it, as I often do with derivatives that appear very different and because i\\'ve only been doing this for a few weeks. Anyways, thanks for the comment, I guess. –\\xa0FuegoJohnson Mar 12 \\'16 at 8:10\\n• When you write \"x^2-6x+12/(x-4)\" you are writing $x^2-6x+\\\\frac{12}{x-4}$, which is not the same as $\\\\frac{x^2-6x+12}{x-4}$. –\\xa0alex.jordan Mar 12 \\'16 at 8:12\\n• @Hirak: Your edit is incorrect. –\\xa0Ted Shifrin Mar 12 \\'16 at 8:18\\n• I know I\\'m sorry, i\\'m going thru the formatting rules right now to make it look better. Sincerest apologies. –\\xa0FuegoJohnson Mar 12 \\'16 at 8:18\\n\\nSometimes when dealing with the derivative of a quotient of polynomials, it is more easy to do some calculations first and then start the derivatives.\\n\\nIn this case, when we do the division of polynomials $\\\\dfrac{x^2-6x+12}{x-4}$ we obtain quotient $x-2$ and residue $4$ (I prefer not to write the division here because depending on how your learn it in school there might be slightly different methods)\\n\\nSo, we get $$x^2-6x+12=(x-2)(x-4)+4$$ and dividing both sides by $(x-4)$ we obtain $$f(x)=\\\\dfrac{x^2-6x+12}{x-4}=(x-2)+\\\\dfrac{4}{x-4}$$\\n\\nIt is somewhat easier to calculate the derivative of this new expression, because when we apply the rule for the quotient one of the derivatives is zero.\\n\\nWhen you take the derivative of the second expression you get\\n\\n$$f\\'(x)=1+\\\\dfrac{0\\\\cdot (x-4)-4(1)}{(x-4)^2}=1-\\\\dfrac{4}{(x-4)^2}$$ which is simpler and especially useful when you will calculate second derivatives and, for example, find the graph of the function.\\n\\n• Thank you for your helpful input! You broke it down in a way that I wasn\\'t able to visualize, and now I see. I ended up finding the second derivative through a much more tedious method, so I think your way would definitely be easier. Thanks :) –\\xa0FuegoJohnson Mar 12 \\'16 at 20:17\\n\\nThey are the same. One way to prove that is the following: $$1-\\\\frac4{(x-4)^2}=\\\\frac{(x-4)^2-4}{(x-4)^2}\\\\\\\\=\\\\frac{x^2-8x+16-4}{(x-4)^2}\\\\\\\\=\\\\frac{x^2-8x+12}{(x-4)^2}$$\\n\\n• Thats really easy to visualize the way you broke it down, thanks. My book skips so many steps sometimes. So my next question for you, is one form \"better\" than the other? I had a really hard time understanding how they simplified the function in my book but seeing you compare them makes a little more sense to me. –\\xa0FuegoJohnson Mar 12 \\'16 at 7:57\\n• @FuegoJohnson For any particular $x$-value, the expression $1-\\\\frac{4}{(x-4)^2}$ takes less arithmetic to evaluate than does the other option. That is one reason to prefer it. Another reason is that it would be more efficient to continue taking higher order derivatives of $1-\\\\frac{4}{(x-4)^2}$, since no quotient rule would be needed. –\\xa0alex.jordan Mar 12 \\'16 at 8:08\\n• Perhaps the best answer would be depending on your purpose. I suppose the $1-\\\\frac{4}{(x-4)^2}$ form would be easier to set to zero for me, but if you prefer the other method it is fine. I suppose the best answer is that the \\'best\\' derivative would be the one which, setting for zero, you can isolate for x the fastest on a test haha. Aside from that, there is no real \\'best\\' derivative. –\\xa0Keith Afas Mar 12 \\'16 at 8:09\\n• Great input, thanks folks. I am about to take the second derivative of the function, so it makes sense that the book answer would be easier to work with, although I STILL don\\'t understand how they simplified it the way they did in the book from the original function. My algebra is kinda rusty at the moment. If someone wants to break it down for me step by step, that would be great lol. –\\xa0FuegoJohnson Mar 12 \\'16 at 8:17',\n",

       "  '# Work and time, when work is split into parts\\n\\nI\\'m stuck on a particular type of work and time problems.\\n\\nFor example,\\n\\n1) A,B,C can complete a work separately in 24,36 and 48 days. They started working together but C left after 4 days of start and A left 3 days before completion of the work. In how many days will the work be completed?\\n\\nA simpler version of the same type of problem is as follows:\\n\\n2) A can do a piece of work in 14 days while B can do it in 21 days. They begin working together but 3 days before the completion of the work, A leaves off. The total number of days to complete the work is?\\n\\nMy attempt at problem 2:\\n\\nA\\'s 1 day work=1/14 and B\\'s 1 day work= 1/21\\n\\nAssume that it takes \\'d\\' days to complete the entire work when both A and B are working together. Then,\\n\\n(1/14 + 1/21)*d= 1\\n\\n-> d=42/5 days.\\n\\nBut it is stated that 3 days before the completion of the work, A left. Therefore, work done by both in (d-3) days is:\\n\\n(1/14 + 1/21)*(42/5 - 3)= 9/14\\n\\nRemaining work= 1- 9/14 = 5/14 which is to be done by B alone. Hence the time taken by B to do (5/14) of the work is:\\n\\n(5/14)*21 = 7.5 days.\\n\\nTotal time taken to complete the work = (d-3) + 7.5 = 12.9 days.\\n\\nHowever, this answer does not concur with the one that is provided.\\n\\nMy Understanding of problem 1:\\n\\nProblem 1 is an extended version of problem 2. But since i think i\\'m doing problem 2 wrong, following the same method on problem 1 will also result in a wrong answer.\\n\\nWhere did i go wrong?\\n\\n## 5 Answers\\n\\nYou asked where you went wrong in solving this problem:\\n\\nA can do a piece of work in 14 days while B can do it in 21 days. They begin working together but 3 days before the completion of the work, A leaves off. The total number of days to complete the work is?\\n\\nAs you said in your solution, $A$ can do $1/14$ of the job per day, and $B$ can do $1/21$ of the job per day. On each day that they work together, then, they do $$\\\\frac1{14}+\\\\frac1{21}=\\\\frac5{42}$$ of the job. Up to here you were doing fine; it’s at this point that you went astray. You know that for the last three days of the job $B$ will be working alone. In those $3$ days he’ll do $$3\\\\cdot\\\\frac1{21}=\\\\frac17$$ of the job. That means that the two of them working together must have done $\\\\frac67$ of the job before $A$ left. This would have taken them\\n\\n$$\\\\frac{6/7}{5/42}=\\\\frac67\\\\cdot\\\\frac{42}5=\\\\frac{36}5\\\\text{ days}\\\\;.$$\\n\\nAdd that to the $3$ days that $B$ worked alone, and you get the correct total: $$\\\\frac{36}5+3=\\\\frac{51}5=10.2\\\\text{ days}\\\\;.$$\\n\\nYou worked out how long it would take them working together, subtracted $3$ days from that, saw how much of the job was left to be done at that point, and added on the number of days that it would take $B$ working alone to finish the job. But as your own figures show, $B$ actually needs $7.5$ days to finish the job at that point, not $3$, so he ends up working alone for $7.5$ days. This means that $A$ actually left $7.5$ days before the end of the job, not $3$ days before. You have to figure out how long it takes them to reach the point at which $B$ can finish in $3$ days.\\n\\nAdded:\\n\\n1) A,B,C can complete a work separately in 24, 36 and 48 days. They started working together but C left after 4 days of start and A left 3 days before completion of the work. In how many days will the work be completed?\\n\\nHere you know that all three worked together for the first $4$ days, $B$ worked alone for the last $3$ days, and $A$ and $B$ worked together for some unknown number of days in the middle. Calculate the fraction of the job done by all three in the first $4$ days and the fraction done by $B$ alone in the last $3$ days, and subtract the total from $1$ to see what fraction was done by $A$ and $B$ in the middle period; then see how long it would take $A$ and $B$ to do that much.\\n\\n• Yes, in short i misinterpreted the question. But because of the line, \"They begin working together but 3 days before the completion of the work, A leaves off\", it seems as if A and B working together would have completed it in some estimated d number of days, 3 days before which A left the job. Hence obviously B would require >3 days to complete the job. How do i avoid such misinterpretations in these types of problems? again, an excellent answer. Thanks! –\\xa0Karan Sep 25 \\'12 at 12:46\\n• @user85030: You’re welcome! I think that avoiding such misinterpretations is partly a matter of practice and partly a matter of reading them pretty literally. Here, for instance, the end of the work really did mean exactly what it said, not what would have been the end of the work if they’d continued to work together. –\\xa0Brian M. Scott Sep 25 \\'12 at 21:52\\n• Can you please have a look at this:- math.stackexchange.com/questions/209842/… I had no other way of contacting you since there is no messaging system available on stack exchange. –\\xa0Karan Oct 9 \\'12 at 19:26\\n\\nIn problem 2 you are misinterpreting the phrase \"$A$ left 3 days before the work was done.\" When you calculate it as above (3 days before the work would\\'ve been done if $A$ worked on), its wrong, as $A$ left (as you calculated) 7.5 days before the work was done.\\n\\nYou can argue as follows: Say the work is done in $d$ days, then $A$ and $B$ work together for $d-3$ days and $B$ alone for $3$ days, doing in total $(d-3) \\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\frac 1{14}+\\\\frac 1{21}\\\\right) + \\\\frac 3{21} = \\\\frac{5(d-3) + 6}{42}$ work.

A=3,B=2.Since A left 3 days prior to the completion of the work, so his 3 days work is absent.Lets add his 3 days pending work to the total amount of work.\\n\\nIn 1 day he does 3 units of work, so in 3 days he will do 9 units of work.\\n\\nTotal work = 42+9 = 51.\\n\\nBoth will now take 3+2 to complete the total work.\\n\\nA+B = 51/5 = 10.2.\\n\\n## protected by Alex M.Mar 19 \\'17 at 18:37\\n\\nThank you for your interest in this question.

       "(a) $\\sqrt{10}$\n",
       "(b) $\\sqrt2+\\sqrt3$\n",
       "(c) $5-\\sqrt3$\n",

       "\n",
       "But this seemed inelegant: I felt there might be some way to manipulate the surd expressions to make the ordering more explicit. I can't see what that might be, however (squaring all the expressions didn't really help).\n",

       "• +1 for providing context (your first two sentences), something that nearly all questions at this level fail to do, and for providing a nice explanation of your concern. Incidentally, for math aptitude and other tests, it has always been my understanding that the questions are NOT testing whether you know the approximations, but whether you can perform the type of analysis in the answer by @Lord Shark the Unknown. Of course, unless the question writer puts some effort behind writing such questions, such questions can often be solved by your method. Sep 19 '18 at 10:41\n",

       "• BBO555, regarding $5$ and $2\\sqrt{6},$ you can simply square again and compare the resulting squared values (although what you did in your comment is quite nice). This relies on the property that, when $a$ and $b$ are positive (or even when they are nonnegative), then we have: $a < b$ if and only if $a^2 < b^2$ (this can be \"seen\" by considering the graph of $y = x^2$ for $x\\geq0).$ Incidentally, the analogous result for cubing also is true and the result for cubing doesn't require the numbers to be positive (consider the graph of $y = x^3).$ Sep 19 '18 at 10:47\n",
       "\n",

       "(1) the fact that $f(x)=x^2$ is a monotonically increasing function when $x\\geq0$ and\n",
       "\n",
       "(2) the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality $\\sqrt{ab}\\leq\\frac{a+b}{2}$, when $a, b\\geq0$. Hence, $$(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3})^2=5+2\\sqrt{2\\cdot3}\\leq5+2\\frac{2+3}{2}=5+5=10=(\\sqrt{10})^2$$ Therefore, using (1), we obtain $\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}\\leq 10$. I forgot about this: $$5-\\sqrt{3}=3+2-\\sqrt{3}=3+\\frac{1}{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\geq3+\\frac{1}{2+2}=3.25$$ One can easily verify that $(3+1/4)^2>10.5>10$. One also finds that $10.5^2>110>101$.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "## Consequently, $5-\\sqrt{3}$ is the bigger number.\n",
       "\n",
       "• I would add that you can also \"round down\" at an intermediate stage of the computation. If you are trying to prove $a \\gt b$ sometimes you can find an expression $c$ that is simpler than $a$ where $a \\gt c$, do some more manipulation, and show $c \\gt b$. The numerical estimates are useful for this because they tell you how much room you have. You might find that rough approximations work, or you might need to be quite careful. Sep 19 '18 at 14:01\n",
